# AI Control Logic â€“ Open Cycle System

## Components:
- Raspberry Pi 5 (main processor)
- Gas composition sensor (FTIR)
- Temperature sensors (x2)
- Flow rate sensor
- Ion chamber voltage controller
- Reagent saturation tracker

## Functions:
- Monitor gas mix from burn
- Adjust ion chamber voltage in real time
- Redirect flow depending on toxicity levels
- Alert if filters are saturated
- Pause combustion if output fails safety threshold
- Log data for diagnostics and improvement
