# YouTube Script – Open Cycle // Breath for the Future

[Scene 1 – Tower in Isolation]
“Out here, where no breath should reach… We’ve built a machine that breathes.”

[Scene 2 – System Layers Glowing]
“It burns the waste. Not to destroy— But to transform.”

[Scene 3 – Vapor rising, particles dancing]
“Ion by ion. Molecule by molecule. Until the air forgets it was ever toxic.”

[Scene 4 – Byproduct tanks, clean mist venting out]
“From ash, water. From poison, breath. From silence, life.”

[Scene 5 – Earth or Mars fade-in, small towers glowing across terrain]
“It learns. It adapts. It never asks for permission.”

[Scene 6 – Starry sky, single tower pulsing light]
“This is not a product. It is a gift. For those who still believe we can make things right.”
