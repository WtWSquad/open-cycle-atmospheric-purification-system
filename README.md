# 🌍 Open Cycle Atmospheric Purification System

This document publicly releases the concept and specifications of the Open Cycle Atmospheric Purification System—an adaptable, modular, closed-loop waste processing tower capable of transforming solid, liquid, or vapor-based waste into clean air and usable byproducts.

It is designed to serve Earth, off-world habitats, disaster recovery zones, and decentralized communities in need of clean air and transformation technology.

No patents. No gatekeeping. This is for you, and for anyone who dreams of restoring breath to the world.

## 🔧 What It Is

A self-contained vertical purification tower that:
- Burns waste
- Ionizes and neutralizes toxic gases
- Reacts molecules through intelligent chemical layers
- Captures usable byproducts like water, salts, or carbon
- Releases clean air only when verified safe

---

## 🧪 What’s Inside

Every component is based on existing, proven science:
- High-temp combustion (arc or induction)
- Cold plasma and ionization grids
- Reactive chemical layers (carbon, zeolite, oxides)
- Thermal quench & condensation
- Smart sensor feedback via low-cost microcontrollers

See the [Builder’s Specification PDF](./Open_Cycle_Builder_Specifications.pdf) for full parts list, material sources, and control system overview.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- 🌪️ Post-disaster toxic zones
- 🌌 Mars or lunar colony prep
- 🧱 Sustainable, off-grid living
- 🏙️ Urban decentralization
- 🧪 DIY survival tech labs
