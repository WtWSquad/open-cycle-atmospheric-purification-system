# ğŸ§ª Peer Review Invitation â€“ Open Cycle Atmospheric Purification System

## Purpose

This document formally invites scientists, engineers, designers, and researchers to provide technical feedback, analysis, and critique of the Open Cycle Atmospheric Purification System.

The system is designed as a closed-loop vertical tower that processes waste through thermal, ionizing, and chemical layers to produce clean air and recover usable byproducts.

This release is open-source and public domain, and intended to evolve with open collaboration and interdisciplinary input.

## What Weâ€™re Asking

We welcome contributions including, but not limited to:

- Technical feasibility analysis (engineering, energy systems, materials)
- Air chemistry and emissions modeling
- Control systems logic evaluation (AI + sensor feedback)
- Reaction pathway validation (for chemical layers)
- Simulation models or software implementations
- Component testing or lab-scale prototypes
- Comparative analysis with industrial purification methods
- Environmental safety assessments
