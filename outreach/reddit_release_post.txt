🚀 I’m releasing a universal, open-source atmospheric purification tower—turns any waste into clean air, and it’s free for the world to build 🌍

After months of theorizing and collaborating with AI, I’m releasing an open-source, freely usable design for a system that can take any waste—burn it safely, break down toxic gases, and purify the resulting air through intelligent, chemical-reactive layers.

It’s called the Open Cycle Atmospheric Purification System.

It’s designed to be:
- Modular
- Scalable
- Off-grid deployable
- Terraforming-ready
- Entirely free from patents, control, or profit

The core idea: trash or toxic air goes in, and clean air comes out. No traditional filters. Just layered physical, electrical, and chemical reactions that keep cycling the gases until they’re transformed or captured as useful byproducts (water, carbon, salts, etc).

Use this in climate crisis zones. In space. In deserts. In disaster recovery. Or just as a symbol of what open tech should be—available to all, owned by no one.

> “There are no patents. No gates. Just breath.”

I’ll be uploading an atmospheric short film and animated visuals to YouTube next week. If you’re an engineer, builder, hacker, futurist, or just a believer in clean air and decentralized solutions—this is for you.
