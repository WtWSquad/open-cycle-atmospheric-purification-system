# Build Phases â€“ Open Cycle System

## Phase 1: Core Combustion & Filter Test
- Build base chamber
- Add manual airflow + ceramic insulation
- Use simple carbon filter at top

## Phase 2: Ionization Integration
- Add corona discharge grid
- Test with smoke & VOC gas
- Monitor with basic gas sensors

## Phase 3: Full Chemical Stack
- Add all reactive layers (zeolite, KMnO4, copper oxide)
- Include replaceable trays and saturation alerts

## Phase 4: Smart AI Control
- Integrate Raspberry Pi
- Add temp/gas flow sensors
- Program response logic for filtration routing

## Phase 5: Full Tower Field Test
- Operate in outdoor or test chamber
- Measure input/output air quality
- Optimize energy use and material swaps
